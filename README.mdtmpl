# serializable

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dart-league/serializable.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dart-league/serializable)

This is a library that generates a serializable class from classes annotated with
`@serializable` or `@Serializable()`.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new dart project.
2. add `serializable` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  serializable: any
  ...
```

3. create a file in `bin` folder called `models.dart` and put next code on it:

{@example example/models.dart}

4. create a file in `bin` folder called `main.dart` and put next code on it:

{@example example/main.dart}

5. create a file in `tool` folder called `build.dart` and put next code on it:

{@example tool/build.dart}

6. run `tool/build.dart`. Then you will see that the file `bin/models.g.dart`
has been generated and it will contains the next code:

{@example example/models.g.dart}

7. Finally you can run the file `bin/main.dart`. If everything is ok you will see next
output in console:

```
p1['id']: 1
p1['name']: person 1
FieldNotFoundException: The key "no_existing" doesn't exist on class "Person"
p1.ToMap(): {id: 1, name: person 1}
p2: {id: 2, name: person 2}
p1: {"id":1,"name":"person 1"}
p3: {id: 3, name: person 3}
```
